This `README.md` is just a placeholder and hold minimal needed information.

# :warning: Attention
I use the gitlab to transfer the files to the Pi. As I have to do *poor man's debugging*, there are and will be a lot of commits of just very small changes

# GIFs
Use with https://github.com/R3tr0BoiDX/TASBot-eye-animations. Only the `gif` subfolder is needed

# Animation injection
To inject animation use the `safer_ninja.py` from here: https://github.com/R3tr0BoiDX/TASBot-Toolkit/blob/master/safer_ninja.py

# Further infos
For more details, please review the review of the original `README.md` from the original software here: https://github.com/R3tr0BoiDX/tasbot_eyes
